#The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value back
#  to caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where
#  it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution 
# immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce 
# a series of values over time, rather them computing them at once and 
# sending them back like a list

#It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file 
# objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its 
# suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point
